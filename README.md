Repository for custom Python script used in comparative RNA-seq and DAP-seq analysis on ABA responses of Brassicaceae species (crucifers).  
Type each script followed by '-h' for more details (pre-requisite, input, parameters, output, etc).
Detailed pipelines to achieve each task (e.g. Phylogenetically informed Profiling) to be added in the near future.
