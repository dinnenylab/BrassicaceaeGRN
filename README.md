# Brassicaceae GRN
Repository for custom Python scripts used in comparative RNA-seq and DAP-seq analyses on ABA responses of Brassicaceae species (crucifers).  

Type each script followed by '-h' for more details (pre-requisite, input, parameters, output, etc).
Pipelines to achieve each task (e.g. Phylogenetically informed Profiling) to be added in the near future.
